# Add-ons

Small, optional Android TV apps that plug into the launcher as a **module card**, kept in this repo
so they are easy to find, build and review. The launcher in [`launcher/`](../launcher/) never
depends on them: it is built, tested and size-checked without this folder, so an add-on can't make
the core bigger or change how it behaves. You install an add-on only if you want it.

A widget, an info tile, a storage or smart-home card: if it can live as its own small app, it can live
here. See the rules below.

## How an add-on works

An add-on is a normal Android TV app with its own Gradle project in `addons/<name>/`. It declares a
card with the existing module-card contract: the how-to is [`docs/modules.md`](../docs/modules.md)
and the spec is [`docs/specs/card.md`](../docs/specs/card.md). The launcher finds the card, asks the
TV owner once, and shows it as a tile with the add-on's label, caption and glow colour. Nothing else
connects the two.

Build one (JDK 17, Android SDK 34, as for the launcher), from the repo root:

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
cd addons/<name> && ./gradlew assembleRelease && cd ../..
TV_HOST=<tv ip> tools/venv/bin/python -I tools/tv.py --push addons/<name>/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk /data/local/tmp/addon.apk
TV_HOST=<tv ip> tools/venv/bin/python -I tools/tv.py 'pm install -r /data/local/tmp/addon.apk; rm -f /data/local/tmp/addon.apk'
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**

```bat
set TV_HOST=<tv ip>
cd addons\<name>
gradlew.bat assembleRelease
cd ..\..
tools\venv\Scripts\python.exe -I tools\tv.py --push addons\<name>\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk /data/local/tmp/addon.apk
tools\venv\Scripts\python.exe -I tools\tv.py "pm install -r /data/local/tmp/addon.apk; rm -f /data/local/tmp/addon.apk"
```

<details>
<summary><b>When something goes wrong with <code>gradlew.bat assembleRelease</code></b></summary>

If the build fails with:

```text
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

What went wrong:
Could not determine the dependencies of task ':app:lintVitalReportRelease'.
> SDK location not found. Define a valid SDK location with an ANDROID_HOME environment variable or by setting the sdk.dir path in your project's local properties file at 'C:\...\addons\<name>\local.properties'.
```

**Solution:**

Create a `local.properties` file inside `addons/<name>/` pointing to your Android SDK installation path:

```properties
sdk.dir=C:/Users/<user name>/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk
```

*(Replace `<user name>` with your Windows user name. Use forward slashes: a backslash is an escape character in this file.)*

</details>

Or let `tools/manage.py` do it the creator's way: it lists every add-on with its screenshot, shows which are on
the TV, and installs, updates or removes one by running the add-on's own `install.sh` or `build-and-install.sh`
(or the three steps above when it has none):
```bash
tools/venv/bin/python -I tools/manage.py list addons
TV_HOST=<tv ip> tools/venv/bin/python -I tools/manage.py status
TV_HOST=<tv ip> tools/venv/bin/python -I tools/manage.py install weather
## Rules

- **Its own app.** One folder per add-on, `addons/<name>/`, with its own Gradle project
  (`settings.gradle`, `app/`), its own package name and its own README.
- **Only through the module-card spec.** An add-on never edits anything under `launcher/`, and
  `launcher/` never references `addons/`. If your idea needs a change inside the launcher, it isn't
  an add-on. Open an issue first instead.
- **No prebuilt APKs** in the repo. People build from source, as with the launcher.
- **Permissions up front.** The add-on's README lists every permission it asks for and why, plus
  any network access or background service, and the Permissions column of the table above carries the
  same list in one line: a reader scanning it sees what each add-on can do without opening its README,
  so an add-on whose manifest asks for something the column leaves out is a bug in this page.
  The rules in [`docs/modules.md`](../docs/modules.md)
  apply: no telemetry without an opt-in, no ads, your own art.
- **Tested on a real TV.** Say which one in the README and in the table above.
- **A screenshot.** `addons/<name>/screenshot.jpg`: the add-on on a real TV, its card in the grid or
  its own screen, as a JPEG, 16:9 (1280×720 is plenty) and under 300 KB, shown in the table's
  Screenshot column. It is what people see first here and on [cleanyour.tv/addons](https://cleanyour.tv/addons).
  Take it with `tools/tv.py --screenshot shot.png` (or `adb exec-out screencap -p > shot.png`), then
  `sips -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 85 -z 720 1280 shot.png --out screenshot.jpg` on a Mac.
  Blur anything personal: Wi-Fi names, people, addresses. Add-ons marked "wanted" in the table came
  before this rule; a screenshot for one of them is welcome.
- **The author maintains it.** Issues about an add-on are assigned to its author. An add-on that
  breaks on current Android TV versions, or goes unmaintained, may be removed. Its history stays in
  git, and you can keep it going in a fork listed in [`SHOWCASE.md`](../SHOWCASE.md).

## Adding one

Open a pull request that adds `addons/<name>/` and one row to the table above. The core CI is not
blocked by add-ons: a separate workflow builds whatever changed under `addons/`, and
`tests/test_addons.py` checks the folder rules (own Gradle project, a README with a Permissions
section, a screenshot, no APKs, a row in this table showing the screenshot) and that the launcher never includes or references this folder.
`tests/test_addon_permissions_index.py` holds each row's Permissions column and the add-on's own
Permissions section to the `uses-permission` lines in its `AndroidManifest.xml`, so a new permission
cannot reach a TV without the two pages saying so.
