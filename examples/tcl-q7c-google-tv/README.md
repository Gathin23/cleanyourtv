# TCL Q7C (G08, Google TV, Android 14), European firmware

TCL Q7C QD-Mini LED, device `G08`, model "Smart TV Pro", product `G08_4K_GB`, firmware `UTT2.250416.001 AU02`,
MediaTek `tcl9618`, about 2.4 GB RAM. The same firmware build as the 85RM7L list and the same G08 board as the
C755, QM6K and 75T7 (US) lists. Set up on Ethernet in Austria. Both halves work on this set: the debloat list and the
Clean Your TV launcher as Home.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `debloat.txt` | The 37 packages that were disabled, grouped and commented |
| `config.json` | Dock, hidden TCL tiles, Live TV app, the Settings and YouTube buttons; push it with `tools/theme.sh` |
| `65q7d-pro-home.png` | Home on the second unit, a TCL 65Q7D Pro (see [Second unit](#second-unit-65q7d-pro-greece-wi-fi)) |

**How much testing is behind it:** one set, from 21 October 2026. The first 35 packages were disabled in five batches
and survived a reboot. launcherx and setupwraith were disabled afterwards, for the new launcher. YouTube, Live TV,
the HDMI list in the Inputs menu, the Input, Settings and YouTube buttons, and D-pad navigation were checked on the
TV.

All commands run from the repo root with the TV's IP in `TV_HOST`. USB debugging must be on while you run them.
On this set, switching it on opens port 5555 by itself. Wireless debugging cannot be switched on over Ethernet,
and it is not needed.

## Install

The order matters: setupwraith goes while Google TV's home still owns Home, then `build-and-install.sh` starts the
new launcher and only then disables launcherx. `disable.sh` skips launcherx on the first run (its Home guard), which
is what you want here, as long as no other launcher is installed: the guard holds launcherx back only when nothing
else could answer Home, so with Projectivy or another launcher on the TV it disables launcherx in the same run, and
that launcher takes Home until `build-and-install.sh` (with `STOCK_LAUNCHER=none`, since it does not know that
launcher) makes the new one Home. Seen on a G08 EU unit, [tcl-g08-eu-android12](../tcl-g08-eu-android12/).

```bash
FORCE_SETUPWRAITH=1 TV_HOST=<tv-ip> tools/disable.sh examples/tcl-q7c-google-tv/debloat.txt
INPUT_KEY_SERVICE=1 HOME_KEY_SERVICE=1 TV_HOST=<tv-ip> launcher/build-and-install.sh
TV_HOST=<tv-ip> tools/theme.sh examples/tcl-q7c-google-tv
```

`FORCE_SETUPWRAITH=1` is only for a set on Ethernet with no saved Wi-Fi: there `dumpsys wifi` shows no network
owner, and `disable.sh` then plays safe and skips setupwraith. On Wi-Fi, run
`tools/tv.py "dumpsys wifi | grep -o 'cname=[^ ]*'"` first. If the network belongs to setupwraith, forget it and
join it again in Settings before you disable the wizard.

`build-and-install.sh` needs JDK 17 for Gradle 8.9. On a Mac where `java_home -v 17` answers with a newer JDK, pass
`JAVA_HOME` explicitly.

## Undo everything

```bash
TV_HOST=<tv-ip> tools/restore.sh examples/tcl-q7c-google-tv/debloat.txt com.google.android.apps.tv.launcherx
```

## Remote buttons

Every button on this remote arrives as scancode 240 (`KEY_UNKNOWN`). TCL's `TclKeyLayoutMap` tells them apart by HID
usage and turns them into keycodes, so map them by keycode (scancode entries would all collide). Found with
`logcat -v time` while pressing the real buttons: look for `InputReader ... TIDD: keyCode=`.

| Button | Keycode | Without Google TV's home | Here |
|---|---|---|---|
| Home | 3 | works | |
| Input | 178 (`KEYCODE_TV_INPUT`) | works: TCL draws its own source panel (`com.tcl.suspension`) | |
| Settings (gear) | 83 (`KEYCODE_NOTIFICATION`) | does nothing (it was launcherx's dashboard) | `settings_key_keycodes: [83]`, `HOME_KEY_SERVICE=1` |
| YouTube | 190 (`KEYCODE_BUTTON_3`) | does nothing | `app_keys: 190:com.google.android.youtube.tv`, `INPUT_KEY_SERVICE=1` |
| Netflix | 4062 | does nothing | left unmapped (Netflix is off) |
| Prime Video | 4099 | does nothing | left unmapped |
| TCL Channel | 4020 | does nothing | left unmapped |
| (app button) | 4057 | does nothing | left unmapped |
| (app button) | 4141 | does nothing | left unmapped |
| Mic | 84 (`KEYCODE_SEARCH`) | with katniss off, opens the Play Store search | |

The YouTube button sends 190 here. The G09 list maps 4065 for its YouTube button, so check yours. Re-pass both
`*_KEY_SERVICE=1` flags on every reinstall: a reinstall drops the services from the accessibility list.

## Notes for this set

- **Check that ADB is really closed when you are done.** Here the USB debugging switch in Developer options
  did not take: `settings get global adb_enabled` still said `1`, and port 5555 was still open after a reboot.
  `tools/tv.py 'settings put global adb_enabled 0'` closed it. The connection drops mid-command, so a non-zero exit is
  expected. Then revoke the authorisations on the TV, reboot, and check with `tools/adb-closed.py <tv-ip>`
  ("Connection refused").
- The UI runs at a 1920×1080 override on the 3840×2160 panel, at 60 Hz: the only display mode Android
  offers. This is the stock setting, not something the launcher changed.
- The Inputs menu lists the HDMI-CEC device names (here "Soundbar · HDMI 1", "PC · HDMI 2") from the TV input
  framework, plus Live TV (`com.tcl.tv`).
- Screenshots of Live TV and HDMI come back empty (0 bytes). `dumpsys activity activities | grep topResumedActivity`
  shows `com.tcl.tv/com.tcl.player.TVActivity`.
- Ambient mode (`dreamx`) was left enabled. Whether its screensaver still works with launcherx off was not checked.

## Second unit: 65Q7D Pro (Greece, Wi-Fi)

One owner's session on 2026-10-22, following [`PROMPT.md`](../../PROMPT.md) on Windows 11 with the repo's
tools (upstream `4c55533`, launcher 2.6). The firmware is the same build as the Q7C above (`G08_4K_GB`, `AU02`),
so `debloat.txt` here is the list to run; this section records the deltas and what differed on this unit. The
packages were applied in five batches with `tools/disable.sh` and checked after one reboot, but they have **not**
been lived with for several days, so nothing was added to `debloat.txt` beyond two header lines naming this unit.

![Reference launcher on the TCL 65Q7D Pro, five-tile dock, rotating wallpaper (greeting name and Wi-Fi name blurred)](65q7d-pro-home.png)

### Identify the firmware

| Field | Observed value |
|---|---|
| Retail model | `65Q7D Pro` (Q7D Pro SQD-Mini LED, 2026), supplied by the owner; not exposed by `ro.product.model` |
| `ro.product.manufacturer` / `ro.product.brand` | `TCL` / `TCL` |
| `ro.product.model` | `Smart TV Pro` |
| `ro.product.name` / `ro.product.device` | `G08_4K_GB` / `G08` |
| Android / SDK | `14` / `34`, Google TV |
| `ro.build.display.id` | `tcl9618-user 14 UTT2.250416.001 AU02 release-keys` |
| `ro.build.fingerprint` | `TCL/G08_4K_GB/G08:14/UTT2.250416.001/AU02:user/release-keys` |
| `ro.software.version_id` | `V8-T653T01-LF1V641` |
| Security patch | `2025-12-05` |
| `ro.hardware` / `ro.board.platform` | `mt5896` / `merak` |
| `ro.adb.secure` | `1` |

`G08_4K_GB` + `AU02` is the pair the Q7C, 85RM7L and 55C745 lists were applied on. The stock launcher is
`com.google.android.apps.tv.launcherx` and the Live TV player is `com.tcl.tv`
(`com.tcl.player.TVActivity`), as on the Q7C.

### Connecting: Wireless debugging only, and its port moves

The Q7C notes above say USB debugging opens port 5555 by itself. **Not on this unit.** With USB debugging on,
5555 kept answering `Connection refused` (the TV was reachable at the same IP). What worked was Developer
options > Wireless debugging, with Google's platform-tools `adb`:

```sh
adb mdns services                       # lists _adb-tls-pairing._tcp while the pairing dialog is open
adb pair <tv ip>:<pairing port> <six-digit code>
adb connect <tv ip>:<connect port>
adb -s <tv ip>:<connect port> tcpip 5555   # now tools/tv.py and the scripts work on 5555
```

- The first time, `adb mdns services` listed both `_adb-tls-pairing._tcp` and `_adb-tls-connect._tcp`. After a
  reboot only the pairing service was advertised, and the connect port had to be read from the TV's
  Wireless debugging screen.
- After the reboot that screen said "IP address and port: unavailable" while pairing still succeeded. Switching
  Wireless debugging off and on again brought the address back.
- `adb tcpip 5555` restarts adbd, so the connect port shown on the TV changes afterwards. Both the new port
  and 5555 worked.
- Forgetting and re-joining the Wi-Fi network (needed for setupwraith, next section) switched Wireless debugging off,
  and a reboot closed 5555. Each time a new pairing code was needed. Plan for three or four pairings in one
  session.
- On Windows, clone the repo to a short path. In a deeply nested folder, `git clone` left files unchecked-out
  and `pip install -r tools/requirements.txt` failed on a `cryptography` file path longer than 260 characters.

### setupwraith owned the Wi-Fi network in use

`tools/tv.py "dumpsys wifi" | grep -o 'cname=[^ ]*'` showed the saved network the TV was connected to with
`cname=com.google.android.tungsten.setupwraith` (a second, older saved network belonged to
`android.uid.system:1000`). The owner forgot the network in Settings and joined it again. After that its
creator was `com.android.tv.settings`, not `android.uid.system` as on the
[QM751G](../../docs/devices/tcl-75qm751g-qm7.md). setupwraith then owned no network, and `tools/disable.sh` disabled it without
`FORCE_SETUPWRAITH`. Wi-Fi stayed up, and the TV kept the same IP.

Order used, as in the Q7C README: setupwraith first, while launcherx still owned Home, then
`STOCK_LAUNCHER=com.google.android.apps.tv.launcherx INPUT_KEY_SERVICE=1 HOME_KEY_SERVICE=1
launcher/build-and-install.sh`, which started the new launcher, disabled launcherx and reported
`Home now resolves to com.gathin.tvhome/.MainActivity`. `mFocusedApp` confirmed it.

### The list as applied

29 packages in five batches, with a screenshot after each. Home, Live TV (`topResumedActivity` =
`com.tcl.tv/com.tcl.player.TVActivity`) and YouTube were checked between batches. launcherx was disabled by
`build-and-install.sh`, not from the list.

Compared with the Q7C list:

| Q7C entry | Here |
|---|---|
| `com.tcl.airplay2`, `com.mediatek.AirplayAPK`, `com.mediatek.airplaydaemon` | Kept: the owner uses AirPlay |
| `com.tcl.UpdatePeripheral` | Kept: a TCL soundbar and subwoofer are connected, and this updates their firmware |
| `com.netflix.ninja`, `com.amazon.amazonvideo.livingroom` | Already disabled by the owner before the session; left as they were |
| `com.netflix.tokenmanager` | Left enabled (installed) |
| `com.google.android.videos` | Not installed on this preload |
| (not in the Q7C list) `com.google.android.apps.mediashell` | Off by choice. The Q7C keeps Chromecast |

Everything the Q7C header leaves alone was left alone here too, including `com.tcl.ttvs`, `com.tcl.eva`,
`com.tcl.tv`, `com.tcl.tvinput`, `com.tcl.suspension` and the firmware updater. `com.tcl.factory.view` is
installed and was not opened.

### Remote buttons, and the volume repeat they cost

The helpers were installed with `INPUT_KEY_SERVICE=1 HOME_KEY_SERVICE=1`, with the Q7C keycodes
(`settings_key_keycodes` `[83]`, `app_keys` `190:com.google.android.youtube.tv`). The owner pressed the real
buttons: **Home, Input, the gear and the YouTube button all worked.**

**Holding Volume + on the TCL remote moved the volume one step per press**, with both helpers bound. This is the
symptom in [the G09 key-repeat note](../../docs/devices/tcl-55p71b-g09-key-repeat.md), now seen on a G08 Google TV 14 build. Only
the "both helpers on" state was tried. The owner kept the helpers, because the soundbar's own remote still
ramps the volume continuously. Someone without a soundbar may prefer `"key_filter": false` or no helpers, and
give up the gear and YouTube buttons instead.

### Launcher config used

Pushed with `tools/theme.sh` (`greeting_name` left out here):

```json
{
  "columns": 5,
  "rows_below_dock": 0,
  "dock_apps": ["com.tcl.tv", "com.apple.atve.androidtv.appletv", "org.xbmc.kodi", "com.wbd.stream",
                "com.google.android.youtube.tv", "tunein.player", "com.windscribe.vpn"],
  "hidden_apps": ["com.tcl.dashboard", "com.tcl.partnercustomizer", "com.tcl.suspension", "com.tcl.gallery"],
  "live_tv_package": "com.tcl.tv",
  "app_labels": ["com.tcl.tv=Live TV", "com.wbd.stream=HBO Max"],
  "settings_key_keycodes": [83],
  "app_keys": ["190:com.google.android.youtube.tv"],
  "cinematic_home": false,
  "wallpaper": true,
  "wallpaper_rotation_minutes": 60
}
```

- With seven dock apps and `columns` 7, the tiles were small. `columns` 5 made them larger. The two extra
  dock apps then lead the grid row under the dock, which `rows_below_dock` 0 keeps mostly off screen until
  Down is pressed.
- `cinematic_home` was tried first. With a wallpaper it covers almost all of the picture with the focused
  app's colour. With it off, the wallpaper shows and the ambient glow still tints it in the focused app's
  colour.
- The `wallpapers/` collection was six 1920×1080 JPEGs drawn locally, 55 to 250 KB each. The
  collection loaded and showed one picture. An hourly change was not watched.

### Reboot and closing ADB

After one reboot, `pm list packages -d` returned the same 33 packages as before it: the 29 above, launcherx, and
the three disabled before the session. Nothing came back. HOME still resolved to `com.gathin.tvhome/.MainActivity`,
and `enabled_accessibility_services` still listed `InputKeyService` and `HomeKeyService`.

To close: `tools/tv.py 'settings put global adb_wifi_enabled 0'`, then `'settings put global adb_enabled 0'`.
The connection dropped during these two writes, and `tools/adb-closed.py <tv ip>` then reported 5555 closed. The owner revoked the USB debugging authorisations,
removed the paired computer, switched Wireless debugging and USB debugging off, and rebooted. Afterwards:

- `tools/adb-closed.py` reported `Connection refused`, and `adb mdns services` listed no ADB service.
- A full TCP scan of the TV found 6465, 6466, 6467, 6553, 7000 (AirPlay, kept), 16794 and 45011 open. 16794 and
  45011 accept a TCP connection, but `adb connect` to them stayed `offline`, so they are not ADB. Both were
  already open while debugging was on.

### Test limits

- One set, one firmware, one session and one reboot. Nothing here has been lived with for several days.
- HDMI inputs, the tuner, channel scanning, AirPlay, the Netflix/Prime/app buttons and the microphone button were
  not tested after the list. Live TV and YouTube were opened, not watched for long.
- Standby/wake, a cold boot from mains, and a firmware update are untested.
- The volume repeat was measured with both helpers bound only. No bisect, and no `key_filter` false run.

## Third unit: 55Q6C (Vietnam, Wi-Fi)

One owner's session on 2026-10-23, following [`PROMPT.md`](../../PROMPT.md) on macOS with Claude Code. `tools/tv.py
--probe` reported `Smart TV Pro`, device `G08`, Android 14 (SDK 34), `tcl9618-user 14 UTT2.250416.001 AU02
release-keys` and `ro.adb.secure = 1`: the same pair as this folder.

### Connecting

- Wireless debugging only, as on the 65Q7D. macOS Local Network privacy blocked every connection from the agent's
  own shell ("No route to host", even to the router). Pairing (`adb pair`) and the first `adb connect` were run from
  an ordinary terminal; that started the adb server there, after which the agent's `adb` reached the TV through it.
  `adb tcpip 5555`, then `adb forward tcp:15555 tcp:5555` with `TV_HOST=127.0.0.1 TV_PORT=15555` gave `tools/` a
  connection, without `tools/relay.py`. The forward dropped once and had to be set again.
- Port 5555 stayed open across both reboots in this session, until debugging was switched off.

### The list as applied

24 packages in four batches with a screenshot after each: this list minus the owner's keeps (Google voice
`katniss`, AirPlay's three packages, `miracast`, Netflix and its token manager, `ui_mediaCenter` for a USB drive,
`t_solo`, `hearaid` and `UpdatePeripheral` for TCL speakers), plus `com.google.android.youtube.tvmusic`.
`com.tcl.magiconnectfree` was already disabled when the session started. After two reboots `pm list packages -d`
still listed all 25, none came back.

### Home without disabling setupwraith

The saved Wi-Fi belonged to setupwraith (`cname=com.google.android.tungsten.setupwraith`), and the owner uses
Chromecast, whose credentials come from setupwraith (`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`). The first
`launcher/build-and-install.sh` run rolled back as designed: Home resolved to `setupwraith/.RecoveryActivity`.

Instead of disabling setupwraith, both it and launcherx stayed enabled and the launcher took Home through
`stock_home_redirect`:

- `config.xml`: `stock_home_redirect` `com.google.android.apps.tv.launcherx`, `settings_key_keycodes` `[83]`,
  `app_keys` `190:com.google.android.youtube.tv` and `4062:com.netflix.ninja`, `live_tv_package` `com.tcl.tv`.
- `STOCK_LAUNCHER=none launcher/build-and-install.sh` installs it and leaves launcherx alone. Its Home check then
  reports launcherx, which is expected here; `HomeKeyService` was enabled afterwards the same way the script does.
- Home from inside YouTube landed on `com.gathin.tvhome/.MainActivity` (`mFocusedApp`), and after a reboot the TV
  started straight into it. Launcherx flashes for a moment before the redirect.
- The owner pressed Home, Settings, YouTube, Netflix and Input on the real remote: all worked. Holding volume up
  kept ramping with `HomeKeyService` bound and `key_filter` true, so the G09 repeat loss did not show on this set.

### TclAppBoot after a reboot

After the first reboot `HomeKeyService` was enabled but unbound, `accessibility_enabled` read `0`, and logcat had
`[TclAppBoot]:forbid bind service ComponentInfo{com.gathin.tvhome/com.gathin.tvhome.HomeKeyService}`.
`appops get com.gathin.tvhome` showed `AUTO_START: ignore`: the install script's `cmd appops set ... AUTO_START
allow` had not reached the disk. `appops set com.gathin.tvhome AUTO_START allow; appops write-settings`, then
clearing and rewriting the enabled list, bound the helper, and it bound on its own after the next reboot. The Sleep
Timer add-on needed the same op (`AUTO_START` here, not `APP_AUTO_START`).

### AirPlay and Cast on this network

AirPlay (Settings > System > AirPlay and HomeKit Settings) was on and listening on port 7000, yet an iPhone found
neither AirPlay nor Cast while the TV and phone were on the router's 5 GHz network (a VNPT iGate GW020-H, whose
pages offer no isolation or multicast setting). With both on its 2.4 GHz network the TV appeared in Screen
Mirroring. That is the router, not the debloat: nothing AirPlay-related was disabled.

### Test limits

- One set, one session, two reboots. Nothing here has been lived with for several days.
- HDMI inputs and the tuner were not used after the list; Live TV opened.
- Private DNS (`dns.adguard-dns.com`) validated and FPT Play loaded; no long playback test.

## Fourth unit: 65T8C (Wi-Fi)

One owner's session on 2026-10-23, following [`PROMPT.md`](../../PROMPT.md) on Linux with Google's platform-tools
`adb` and launcher 2.6. Same build as the Q7C (`G08_4K_GB`, `UTT2.250416.001 AU02`, `ro.software.version_id`
`V8-T653T01-LF1V643`, security patch `2025-12-05`), so `debloat.txt` here is the list to run. Packages were
disabled by hand, one `pm disable-user` call each, in seven batches with a screenshot after each; the first 34
were checked after one reboot. The owner then used the TV for a few days with nothing broken or re-enabled. Nothing
was added to `debloat.txt` beyond a header line naming this unit; the deltas are below.

| Field | Observed value |
|---|---|
| Retail model | `65T8C`, supplied by the owner; not exposed by `ro.product.model` (`Smart TV Pro`) |
| `ro.hardware` / `ro.board.platform` | `mt5896` / `merak` |
| Apps on the set | Middle East apps: OSN+, TOD, Shahid, Disney+ (`com.disneyplus.mea`), iQIYI |

### What differed from the Q7C list

- **Kept by choice:** AirPlay, Chromecast (mediashell), Prime Video and the game bar. The Q7C list disables AirPlay
  and Prime Video.
- **Also disabled, beyond the Q7C list:** `com.tcl.interactive`, `com.tcl.partnercustomizer`, `com.tcl.gallery`,
  Shahid, Disney+ MEA, iQIYI, YouTube Music, and the TCL keyboard `com.tcl.inputmethod.international`. The TCL
  keyboard is the default IME on this set: `ime enable` and
  `ime set com.google.android.inputmethod.latin/com.android.inputmethod.latin.LatinIME` first, or nothing can type. Disabling `com.tcl.interactive` did not break the Input button here, unlike the Android 12
  G08 list's warning.
- **Kept:** `com.tcl.ttvs`, which carries the system update screens on this build.

### Notes for this unit

- **Wireless debugging only**, like the 65Q7D Pro: port 5555 was closed with USB debugging on. After a reboot,
  Wireless debugging showed its IP address & port as "unavailable"; pairing still succeeded but every connect
  answered `offline`. Toggling did not help; unplugging the TV at the wall did, and it came back on a new port.
- **The saved Wi-Fi belonged to `android.uid.system`**, not setupwraith, so the wizard could be disabled without
  losing Wi-Fi. With launcherx off and setupwraith on, `query-activities` listed setupwraith's `RecoveryActivity`
  above the new launcher; `set-home-activity` plus disabling both made `mFocusedApp` the new launcher.
- **Closing ADB:** with Wireless debugging off but USB debugging still on, port 5555 was open after a reboot and
  advertised `_adb._tcp`. Switching USB debugging off and rebooting closed it (`tools/adb-closed.py`).
- **Checked with the real remote:** Home, the app buttons, Input, Settings and holding volume all worked with the
  new launcher and no key helpers enabled.

## Additional G08 AU02 unit: native shortcuts and held-volume repeat

One `Smart TV Pro`, device `G08`, product `G08_4K_GB`, Android TV 14 (SDK 34), build
`tcl9618-user 14 UTT2.250416.001 AU02 release-keys`. The retail model was not confirmed. The owner tested
launcher 2.7 from macOS on 2026-10-23; [issue #1292](https://github.com/Gathin23/cleanyourtv/issues/1292)
records the result.

With `com.google.android.apps.tv.launcherx` disabled, the real remote's Netflix (`4062`), Prime Video (`4099`)
and YouTube (`190`) buttons stopped opening their apps. Disney+ and Globoplay buttons still worked.
Enabling `HomeKeyService` with key filtering restored the failed shortcuts, but holding volume then moved
it one step per press, as in [the G09 key-repeat note](../../docs/devices/tcl-55p71b-g09-key-repeat.md).

### Working alternative: Google TV handles the app buttons

Keeping launcherx enabled and redirecting its Home windows let the owner keep those shortcuts and held-volume
repeat together. The two settings for this mode were:

```json
{
  "key_filter": false,
  "stock_home_redirect": "com.google.android.apps.tv.launcherx"
}
```

- Leave `com.google.android.apps.tv.launcherx` enabled, unlike the standard install above. Google TV's native
  receiver handles the app buttons; `app_keys` in a key-filtering helper is not what restores them here.
- Enable only `com.gathin.tvhome/.HomeKeyService`, with `InputKeyService` off. The Home helper observes window
  changes without filtering keys. Android still resolves Google TV as Home; the helper opens Clean Your TV.
- Allow `AUTO_START` for `com.gathin.tvhome` and persist it with `appops write-settings`, as in
  [TclAppBoot after a reboot](#tclappboot-after-a-reboot).
- On this unit setupwraith stayed disabled after the owner forgot and rejoined Wi-Fi in Settings. The saved
  network then belonged to `com.android.tv.settings`; this differs from the third unit, which kept the wizard.

### Verification and limits

The owner pressed Home, Netflix, Prime Video and YouTube on the physical remote: Home returned to Clean Your TV,
the three apps opened, and held volume changed continuously.

After a reboot, before injecting navigation keys, the focused app was `com.gathin.tvhome/.MainActivity`.
`dumpsys accessibility` showed only `HomeKeyService` bound, with `TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED`, and no
`KeyboardInterceptor`. The helper also remained bound after a later `tools/theme.sh` push.

Keeping Google TV enabled retains its process and can briefly show the stock Home during startup before the
redirect. This is a compatibility alternative to disabling launcherx. The owner later chose direct Home with
launcherx disabled, accepting the lost shortcuts.

One unit, one firmware and one setup session, including a checked reboot of the redirect configuration.
This does not establish long-term stability or validate the folder's full debloat list. No packages were added
to `debloat.txt` for this report.
## Fifth unit: G08 EU/UK, OTA from Android 12
TCL Smart TV Pro, product `G08_4K_GB`, firmware `UTT2.250416.001 AU02`, EU/UK unit on Ethernet with a custom
launcher (launcherx and setupwraith off). This set is the source of the groups marked "fifth unit" in
`debloat.txt`; it OTA'd from Android 12 (the Android 12 list of this exact set, PR #657) to Android 14 on
21 October 2026, and its Android 12 debloat entries were audited against the OTA.
- **OTA survival:** no disabled package came back from the update. The OTA newly installed `com.tcl.channelplus`
  (in the list) — re-run `tools/disable.sh` after every update, it will pick up the new packages on the list.
- `com.iplayer.android.webview` from the Android 12 firmware is gone from this build.
- **Source key / QuickPanel:** the remote Source key is keycode 178 (`KEYCODE_TV_INPUT`). With launcherx gone,
  `com.tcl.suspension` draws the source QuickPanel itself (`input keyevent 178` → `QuickPanelDialog` in logcat,
  confirmed with the real remote). The DO-NOT-DISABLE set for this: `com.tcl.autopair`, `com.tcl.suspension`,
  `com.tcl.interactive`, `com.tcl.ttvs` — disabling them shows the known ~10 Hz NPE storm in logcat.
- **`com.tcl.ttvs` is not analytics-only:** on a related AU04 G08 unit, `dumpsys package com.tcl.ttvs` lists
  firmware-update components (`versionUpdateApp` `SystemUpdateActivity`, `NetworkUpdateActivity`,
  `SystemUpdateReceiver`, package `10.60.15_422bf21_260617_overseaTV`) — check the package before treating it
  as telemetry. (Report from PR #1085's unit; left enabled there.)
- **Kept enabled:** the TCL keyboard `com.tcl.inputmethod.international` and `com.tcl.browser` — the browser is
  what the remote's Web key opens on this firmware. Verified on the set: boot, Live TV/HDMI playback, the Source
  key panel, streaming preloads and the Google stack.
- **Never list** `com.google.android.modulemetadata` and the `com.google.android.overlay.modules.*` overlays
  (permissioncontroller, modulemetadata-forframework): `tools/disable.sh` refuses a list that names them
  (brick class, #884). The Android 12 EU list named them before the tool gate existed; they are excluded here.

## Sixth unit: 55C69K (Europe, Wi-Fi)

One owner's session on 2026-10-26, following [`PROMPT.md`](../../PROMPT.md) on Windows 11 with Claude Code and the
repo's PowerShell tools (`tools/disable.ps1`, `launcher/build-and-install.ps1`; no platform-tools `adb`). Same pair as
this folder, so `debloat.txt` here is the list to run; this section records the deltas.

| Field | Observed value |
|---|---|
| Retail model | `55C69K`, supplied by the owner; not exposed by `ro.product.model` (`Smart TV Pro`) |
| `ro.product.name` / `ro.product.device` | `G08_4K_GB` / `G08` |
| Android / SDK | `14` / `34`, Google TV |
| `ro.build.fingerprint` | `TCL/G08_4K_GB/G08:14/UTT2.250416.001/AU02:user/release-keys` |
| `ro.software.version_id` | `V8-T653T01-LF1V643` |
| Security patch | `2025-12-05` |
| `ro.hardware` / `ro.board.platform` | `mt5896` / `merak` |
| `ro.boot.client_type` | `TCL-EU-MT9653-S1` |
| `ro.adb.secure` | `1` |

### Connecting and closing

- **Port 5555 opened directly** with USB debugging and Network debugging on, unlike the Wireless-debugging-only
  65Q7D Pro and 65T8C. It came back by itself after both reboots done with debugging on.
- **Closing worked from the switches:** Network debugging and USB debugging off, authorisations revoked, reboot;
  `tools/adb-closed.py` then answered `Connection refused`. The `adb_enabled` problem in the Q7C notes did not show.
- **Windows, antivirus with HTTPS scanning (Avast):** `sdkmanager` and Gradle failed with `PKIX path building
  failed`, because the scanner re-signs TLS with a root that Windows trusts and Java does not. Passing
  `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=Windows-ROOT` in `SDKMANAGER_OPTS` and `GRADLE_OPTS` fixed both. The same option
  in `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` stops `launcher/build-and-install.ps1`: Java prints a notice on stderr, which the script's
  `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` treats as a failure.
- **Windows PowerShell 5.1** drops the inner double quotes of a `tools/tv.py "... grep -E '...'"` argument; piping
  the commands into `tools/tv.py --batch` keeps them intact.

### setupwraith and the saved Wi-Fi

The network in use belonged to `android.uid.system`. One older saved network, not in range and not in use, belonged
to `com.google.android.tungsten.setupwraith`. With the owner's agreement it was removed with
`tools/tv.py 'cmd wifi forget-network <id>'` (ids from `cmd wifi list-networks`), as the US G08 third unit did;
`tools/disable.ps1` then disabled the wizard without `FORCE_SETUPWRAITH`, and Wi-Fi and ADB stayed up.

### The list as applied

41 packages in five batches with `tools/disable.ps1` and a screenshot after each, then setupwraith, then launcherx
through `launcher/build-and-install.ps1`: 43 in all.
After three reboots `pm list packages -d` still listed all 43; the firmware re-enabled nothing. Compared with this folder's list:

| Q7C entry or group | Here |
|---|---|
| `com.tcl.tv.tclhome_passive`, `com.google.android.onetimeinitializer`, `com.tcl.UpdatePeripheral` | Kept (not tried) |
| `com.google.android.katniss` | Kept: the owner uses Google Assistant |
| (kept on the Q7C) `com.tcl.dashboard` | Disabled; no problem noticed in one day with the new launcher as Home |
| (kept on the Q7C) `com.google.android.apps.mediashell`, `com.tcl.gamebar` | Disabled by choice |
| ("not touched" on the Q7C) `com.tcl.eva`, `com.tcl.gallery` | Disabled; `eva` as TCL's voice layer (the EU and AU G08 lists disable it too; voice search was not tested afterwards), `gallery` by choice (nothing on USB) |
| (fifth-unit groups) `com.tcl.android.webview`, `com.mediatek.support.webview`, `com.mediatek.network`, `com.mediatek.backgrounddetection` | Disabled here too; `dumpsys webviewupdate` named `com.google.android.webview` as the active provider first |
| (not in the list) `com.google.android.youtube.tvmusic` | Disabled by choice |

Left alone, as on the Q7C: `com.tcl.tv`, `com.tcl.tvinput`, `com.tcl.suspension`, `com.tcl.interactive`,
`com.tcl.ttvs`, `com.tcl.autopair`, the TCL keyboard, `com.tvos`, `com.tpa.kb` and the firmware updater.
`com.tcl.factory.view` was not opened.

### Remote buttons without a key helper

No key helper was installed. On the real remote, Home, Input (TCL's source panel) and YouTube worked with launcherx
off; the gear did nothing. The gear's keycode 83 reaches the focused window here (`logcat`:
`InputDispatcher: TIDD: publishKeyEvent(... com.gathin.tvhome/...MainActivity ..., keyCode=83)`), so
`settings_key_keycodes` `[83]` in `config.xml` answers it while Home is in front **without `HomeKeyService`**,
and the owner confirmed it opens Settings. Inside an app the button still goes to that app. With no helper bound,
a held Volume + moves one step and then repeats slowly (`repeatCount=1` after about 400 ms in `logcat`): that is
this firmware's own volume handling, not the helper trade described in the G09 note.

### Other checks

- Power-on lands on the new launcher (`wm_set_resumed_activity`: `FallbackHome`, then `com.gathin.tvhome`); the
  firmware does not open Live TV by itself, so neither `power_on_home` nor `boot_to_live_tv` is needed.
- The Inputs menu listed HDMI 1 to 4 and Live TV; HDMI 1 opened `com.tcl.tv/com.tcl.player.TVActivity`.
- Private DNS (`dns.adguard-dns.com`) validated, and YouTube loaded its feed through it.

### Test limits

- One set, one day, three reboots. Nothing here has been lived with for several days, so `debloat.txt` only gains a
  header line naming this unit.
- Nothing was connected to the HDMI inputs; the tuner, channel scanning and Live TV playback were not tested.
- Casting and mirroring were turned off by choice, so they were not tested after the list.
