"""The translation recipe names the release APK's size gate, which a new language can fail.

`docs/workflows/translation.md` is the only page a translator reads. Its step 1 asks for every string
in `values/strings.xml`, so a full language is by far the largest thing a translation pull request
adds to `launcher/app/src/main/res/` - and the release APK has a hard budget:
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s `launcher` job, which runs on every pull request in `launcher/`, measures
`launcher/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` and fails the build at 589,824 B. The launcher
ships just under that (README.md quotes about 532 KB), and #1271 is a full Korean translation that did
not fit. Until now the page said nothing about it, so a translator could follow the recipe exactly and
land a red build at a step the page never mentions.

The numbers are not copied into the test: the APK path, the limit and the command it is measured with
are read out of `ci.yml`, and the job is checked to still run on pull requests rather than only on
`main` - a gate moved behind `if: github.event_name == 'push'` would make the page's advice wrong, so
that fails here instead of quietly letting the recipe drift.
